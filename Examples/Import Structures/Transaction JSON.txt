AccountWrapper{
  "a": string
  "c": string
  "v": decimal
}

a: the account name
c: D for debit, C for credit, G for ghost, or T for tracking
v: the value.  this should generally be a positive number if debit or credit

TransactionCapsule{
  "u": integer
  "t": integer
  "e": string
  "i": string
  "d": string
  "a": array(AccountWrapper)
  "m": object
}

u: unique identifier for the capsule
t: the date of the transaction as a unix millisecond timestamp
e: the legal entity or person the transaction was with
i: the items bought, sold, or traded, if applicable
d: notes about the transaction
a: a series of accounts and values that, hopefully, are balanced
m: transaction metadata.  Anything can be added, but the program will only recognize certain structures.

AssetChangeMetadata array: "asset-change"
AssetMetadata array: "asset"
CheckMetadata array: "check"
LedgerMetadata array: "ledger"
LoanChangeMetadata array: "loan-change"
LoanMetadata array: "loan"

NOTE: all of these MUST be arrays.  that's how the software is set up.
